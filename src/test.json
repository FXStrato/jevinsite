    title: "Viziometrics: Analyzing Visual Information in the Scientific Literature (2016)",
    abstract: "Scientific results are communicated visually in the literature through diagrams, visualizations, and photographs. These information-dense objects have been largely ignored in bibliometrics and scientometrics studies when compared to citations and text. In this paper, we use techniques from computer vision and machine learning to classify more than 8 million figures from PubMed into 5 figure types and study the resulting patterns of visual information as they relate to impact. We find that the distribution of figures and figure types in the literature has remained relatively constant over time, but can vary widely across field and topic. Remarkably, we find a significant correlation between scientific impact and the use of visual information, where higher impact papers tend to include more diagrams, and to a lesser extent more plots and photographs. To explore these results and other ways of extracting this visual information, we have built a visual browser to illustrate the concept and explore design alternatives for supporting viziometric analysis and organizing visual information. We use these results to articulate a new research agenda -- viziometrics -- to study the organization and presentation of visual information in the scientific literature.",

    title: "Men set their own cites high: Gender and self-citation across fields and over time (2016)",
    abstract: "How common is self-citation in scholarly publication and does the practice vary by gender? Using novel methods and a dataset of 1.5 million research papers in the scholarly database JSTOR published between 1779-2011, we find that nearly 10% of references are self-citations by a paper's authors. We further find that over the years between 1779-2011, men cite their own papers 56% more than women do. In the last two decades of our data, men self-cite 70% more than women. Women are also more than ten percentage points more likely than men to not cite their own previous work at all. Despite increased representation of women in academia, this gender gap in self-citation rates has remained stable over the last 50 years. We break down self-citation patterns by academic field and number of authors, and comment on potential mechanisms behind these observations. These findings have important implications for scholarly visibility and likely consequences for academic careers.",

    title: "Leveraging Citation Networks to Visualize Scholarly Influence Over Time (2016)",
    abstract: "Assessing the influence of a scholar's work is an important task for funding organizations, academic departments, and researchers. Common methods, such as measures of citation counts, can ignore much of the nuance and multidimensionality of scholarly influence. We present an approach for generating dynamic narrative visualizations of scholars' careers. This approach uses an animated node-link diagram showing the citation network accumulated around the researcher over the course of the career in concert with key indicators, highlighting influence both within and across fields. We developed our design in collaboration with one funding organizationu2014the Pew Biomedical Scholars programu2014but the methods are generalizable to visualizations of scholarly influence in general. We applied the design method to the Microsoft Academic Graph, which includes more than 120 million publications. We validate our abstractions throughout the process through collaboration with the Pew Biomedical Scholars program officers and summative evaluations with their scholars.",

    title: "Toward the Operationalization of Visual Metaphor (2017)",
    abstract: "Many successful digital interfaces employ visual metaphors to convey features or data properties to users, but the characteristics that make a visual metaphor effective are not well-understood. We used a theoretical conception of metaphor from cognitive linguistics to design an interactive system for viewing the citation network of the corpora of literature in the JSTOR database, a highly connected compound graph of 2 million papers linked by 8 million citations. We created four variants of this system, manipulating two distinct properties of metaphor. We conducted a between-subjects experimental study with 80 participants to compare understanding and engagement when working with each version. We found that building on known image schemas improved response time on lookup tasks, while contextual detail predicted increases in persistence and the number of inferences drawn from the data. Schema-congruency combined with contextual detail produced the highest gains in comprehension. These findings provide concrete mechanisms by which designers presenting large data sets through metaphorical interfaces may improve their effectiveness and appeal with users.",

    title: "All Patents Great and Small - A Big Data Network Approach to Valuation (2016)",
    abstract: "Measuring patent value is an important goal of scholars in both patent law and patent economics.  However, doing so objectively, accurately and consistently has proved exceedingly difficult.  At least part of the reason for this difficulty is that patents themselves are complex documents that are difficult even for patent experts to interpret.  In addition, issued patents are the result of an often long and complicated negotiation between applicant and patent office (in the United States, the United States Patent & Trademark Office ("USPTO")), the result of which is an opaque u201cprosecution historyu201d upon which depend the scope of claimed patent rights.  In this Article, we approach the concept of patent value by using the relative positions of issued United States ("U.S.") patents embedded within a comprehensive patent citation network to measure the importance of those patents within the network.  Thus, we tend to refer to the "importance" of patents instead of "value", but there is good reason to believe that these two concepts share a very similar meaning.",

    title: "Scalable and Efficient Flow-Based Community Detection for Large-Scale Graph Analysis (2016)",
    abstract: "Community detection is a powerful approach to uncover important structures in large networks. For real networks that often describe the flow of some entity, flow-based community detection methods are particularly important. Infomap is a flow-based community detection algorithm that optimizes the objective function known as the map equation. Third-party benchmarks have found that Infomap is the most effective algorithm for identifying clusters in large graphs. Unfortunately, though Infomap works well, it is an inherently serial algorithm and thus cannot take advantage of multi-core processing in modern computers, limiting its use for analyzing large graphs quickly. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to optimize the map equation called RelaxMap. RelaxMap provides two important improvements over Infomap: parallelization, so that the map equation can be optimized over much larger graphs, and prioritization, so that the most important work occurs first, iterations take less time, and the algorithm converges faster. We implement these techniques using OpenMP on shared-memory multicore systems, and evaluate our approach on a variety of graphs from standard graph clustering benchmarks as well as real graph datasets. Our evaluation shows that both techniques are effective: RelaxMap achieves 70% parallel efficiency on 8 cores, and prioritization improves algorithm performance by an additional 20%u201350% in average, depending on the graph properties. Additionally, RelaxMap converges in the similar number of iterations and provides solutions of equivalent quality as the serial Infomap implementation.",

    title: "A recommendation system based on hierarchical clustering of an article-level citation network (2016)",
    abstract: "To better understand the flows of ideas or information through social and biological systems, researchers develop maps that reveal important patterns in network flows. In practice, network flow models have implied memoryless first-order Markov chains, but recently researchers have introduced higher-order Markov chain models with memory to capture patterns in multi-step pathways. Higher-order models are particularly important for effectively revealing actual, overlapping community structure, but higher-order Markov chain models suffer from the curse of dimensionality: their vast parameter spaces require exponentially increasing data to avoid overfitting and therefore make mapping inefficient already for moderate-sized systems. To overcome this problem, we introduce an efficient cross-validated mapping approach based on network flows modeled by sparse Markov chains. To illustrate our approach, we present a map of citation flows in science with research fields that overlap in multidisciplinary journals. Compared with currently used categories in science of science studies, the research fields form better units of analysis because the map more effectively captures how ideas flow through science.",

    title: "The Academic Advantage: Gender Disparities in Patenting (2015)",
    abstract: "We analyzed gender disparities in patenting by country, technological area, and type of as- signee using the 4.6 million utility patents issued between 1976 and 2013 by the United States Patent and Trade Office (USPTO). Our analyses of fractionalized inventorships dem- onstrate that womenu2019s rate of patenting has increased from 2.7% of total patenting activity to 10.8% over the nearly 40-year period. Our results show that, in every technological area, female patenting is proportionally more likely to occur in academic institutions than in corpo- rate or government environments. However, womenu2019s patents have a lower technological impact than that of men, and that gap is wider in the case of academic patents. We also pro- vide evidence that patents to which womenu2014and in particular academic womenu2014contribut- ed are associated with a higher number of International Patent Classification (IPC) codes and co-inventors than men. The policy implications of these disparities and academic set- ting advantages are discussed.",

    title: "Memory in network flows and its effects on spreading dynamics and community detection (2014)",
    abstract: "Random walks on networks is the standard tool for modelling spreading processes in social and biological systems. This first-order Markov approach is used in conventional community detection, ranking and spreading analysis, although it ignores a potentially important feature of the dynamics: where flow moves to may depend on where it comes from. Here we analyse pathways from different systems, and although we only observe marginal consequences for disease spreading, we show that ignoring the effects of second-order Markov dynamics has important consequences for community detection, ranking and information spreading. For example, capturing dynamics with a second-order Markov model allows us to reveal actual travel patterns in air traffic and to uncover multidisciplinary journals in scientific communication. These findings were achieved only by using more available data and making no additional assumptions, and therefore suggest that accounting for higher-order memory in network flows can help us better understand how real systems are organized and function.",

No formalism has been available to characterize these u201ccultural holes.u201d Here we use information theory to measure cultural holes and demonstrate our formalism in the context of scientific communication using papers from JSTOR. We extract scientific fields from the structure of citation flows and infer field-specific cultures by cataloging phrase frequencies in full text and measuring the relative efficiency of between-field communication. We then combine citation and cultural information in a novel topographic map of science, mapping citations to geographic distance and cultural holes to topography. By analyzing the full citation network, we find that communicative efficiency decays with citation distance in a field-specific way. These decay rates reveal hidden patterns of cohesion and fragmentation. For example, the ecological sciences are balkanized by jargon, whereas the social sciences are relatively integrated. Our results highlight the importance of enriching structural analyses with cultural data.",

    title: "The Role of Gender in Scholarly Authorship (2013)",
    abstract: "Gender disparities appear to be decreasing in academia according to a number of metrics, such as grant funding, hiring, acceptance at scholarly journals, and productivity, and it might be tempting to think that gender inequity will soon be a problem of the past. However, a large-scale analysis based on over eight million papers across the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities reveals a number of understated and persistent ways in which gender inequities remain. For instance, even where raw publication counts seem to be equal between genders, close inspection reveals that, in certain fields, men predominate in the prestigious first and last author positions. Moreover, women are significantly underrepresented as authors of single-authored papers. Academics should be aware of the subtle ways that gender disparities can occur in scholarly authorship.",

    title: "Author-Level Eigenfactor Metrics: Evaluating the Influence of Authors, Institutions and Countries Within the SSRN Community (2013)",
    abstract: "In this article, we show how the Eigenfactor score, originally designed for ranking scholarly journals, can be adapted to rank the scholarly output of authors, institutions, and countries based on author-level citation data. Using the methods described in this article, we provide Eigenfactor rankings for 84,808 disambiguated authors of 240,804 papers in the Social Science Research Network (SSRN)u2014a preprint and postprint archive devoted to the rapid dissemination of scholarly research in the social sciences and humanities. As an additive metric, the Eigenfactor scores are readily computed for collectives such as departments or institutions as well. We show that a collectiveu2019s Eigenfactor score can be computed either by summing the Eigenfactor scores of its members or by working directly with a collective-level cross-citation matrix. We provide Eigenfactor rankings for institutions and countries in the SSRN repository. With a network-wide comparison of Eigenfactor scores and download tallies, we demonstrate that Eigenfactor scores provide information that is both different from and complementary to that provided by download counts. We see author-level ranking as one filter for navigating the scholarly literature, and note that such rankings generate incentives for more open scholarship, because authors are rewarded for making their work available to the community as early as pos- sible and before formal publication.",

    abstract: "The Eigenfactor Metrics provide an alternative way of evaluating scholarly journals based on an iterative ranking procedure analogous to Googleu2019s PageRank algorithm. These metrics have recently been adopted by Thomson Reuters and are listed alongside the Impact Factor in the Journal Citation Reports. But do these metrics differ sufficiently so as to be a useful addition to the bibliometric toolbox? Davis (2008) has argued that they do not, based on his finding of a 0.95 correlation coefficient between Eigenfactor score and Total Citations for a sample of journals in the field of medicine. This conclusion is mistaken; in this article, we illustrate the basic statistical fallacy to which Davis succumbed. We provide a complete analysis of the 2006 Journal Citation Reports and demonstrate that there are statistically and economically significant differences between the information provided by the Eigenfactor Metrics and that provided by Impact Factor and Total Citations.",

    title: "Differences in Impact Factor across fields and over time (2008)",
    abstract: "The bibliometric measure impact factor is a leading indicator of journal influence, and impact factors are routinely used in making decisions ranging from selecting journal subscriptions to allocating research funding to deciding tenure cases. Yet journal impact factors have increased gradually over time, and moreover impact factors vary widely across academic disciplines. Here we quantify inflation over time and differences across fields in impact factor scores and determine the sources of these differences. We find that the average number of citations in reference lists has increased gradually, and this is the predominant factor responsible for the inflation of impact factor scores over time. Field-specific variation in the fraction of citations to literature indexed by Thomson Scientificu2019s Journal Citation Reports is the single greatest contributor to differences among the impact factors of journals in different fields. The growth rate of the scientific literature as a whole, and cross-field differences in net size and growth rate of individual fields, have had very little influence on impact factor inflation or on cross-field differences in impact factor.",

Conversely, the structure of social systems can influence the evolutionary trajectories of pathogens. While much attention has focused on the evolution of host sociality or pathogen virulence separately, few studies have looked at their coevolution. Here we use an agent-based simulation to explore hostu2013pathogen coevolution in social contact networks. Our results indicate that under certain conditions, both host sociality and pathogen virulence exhibit continuous cycling. The way pathogens move through the network (e.g., their interhost transmission and probability of superinfection) and the structure of the network can influence the existence and form of cycling.",

    title: "Dynamics of stomatal patches for a single surface of Xanthium strumarium L. leaves observed with flourescence and thermal images (2005)",
    abstract: "Fluorescence and thermal imaging were used to examine the dynamics of stomatal patches for a single surface of Xanthium strumarium L. leaves following a decrease in ambient humidity. Patches were not observed in all experiments, and in many experiments the patches were short lived. In some experiments, however, patches persisted for many hours and showed complex temporal and spatial patterns. Rapidly sampled fluorescence images showed that the measurable variations of these patches were sufficiently slow to be captured by fluorescence images taken at 3-min intervals using a saturating flash of light. Stomatal patchiness with saturating flashes of light was not demonstrably different from that without saturating flashes of light, suggesting that the regular flashes of light did not directly cause the phenomenon. Comparison of simultaneous fluorescence and thermal images showed that the fluorescence patterns were largely the result of stomatal conductance patterns, and both thermal and fluorescence images showed patches of stomatal conductance that propagated coherently across the leaf surface. These nondispersing patches often crossed a given region of the leaf repeatedly at regular intervals, resulting in oscillations in stomatal conductance for that region. The existence of these coherently propagating structures has implications for the mechanisms that cause patchy stomatal behaviour as well as for the physiological ramifications of this phenomenon.",

    title: "Evidence for complex, collective dynamics and emergent, distributed computation in plants (2004)",
    abstract: "It has been suggested that some biological processes are equivalent to computation, but quantitative evidence for that view is weak. Plants must solve the problem of adjusting stomatal apertures to allow sufficient CO2 uptake for photosynthesis while preventing excessive water loss. Under some conditions, stomatal apertures become synchronized into patches that exhibit richly complicated dynamics, similar to behaviors found in cellular automata that perform computational tasks. Using sequences of chlorophyll fluorescence images from leaves of Xanthium strumarium L. (cocklebur), we quantified spatial and temporal correlations in stomatal dynamics. Our values are statistically indistinguishable from those of the same correlations found in the dynamics of automata that compute. These results are consistent with the proposition that a plant solves its optimal gas exchange problem through an emergent, distributed computation performed by its leaves.",

Machines can be trained to do this at large scale, feeding search engines and recommendation algorithms. Citations and text are the features commonly used for these tasks. In this paper, we focus on a largely ignored facet of scholarly papersu2014the equations. Mathematical language varies from field to field but original formulae are maintained over generations (e.g., Shannonu2019s Entropy equation). Here we extract a common set of mathematical symbols from more than 250,000 LATEX source files in the arXiv repository. We compare the symbol distributions across different fields and calculate the jargon distance between fields. We find a greater difference between the experimental and theoretical disciplines than within these fields. This provides a first step at using equations as a bridge between disciplines that may not cite each other or may speak different natural languages but use a similar mathematical language.",

Yet, little quantitative research has analyzed the causes and possible remedies for student attrition. Here, we describe initial efforts to model student dropout using the largest known dataset on higher education attrition, which tracks over 32,500 students' demographics and transcript records at one of the nation's largest public universities. Our results highlight several early indicators of student attrition and show that dropout can be accurately predicted even when predictions are based on a single term of academic transcript data. These results highlight the potential for machine learning to have an impact on student retention and success while pointing to several promising directions for future work.",

New ideas are conveyed visually in the scientific literature through figures u2014 diagrams, photos, vi- sualizations, tables u2014 but these visual elements remain en- sconced in the surrounding paper and difficult to use directly to facilitate information discovery tasks or longitudinal an- alytics. Very few applications in information retrieval, aca- demic search, or bibliometrics make direct use of the figures, and none attempt to recognize and exploit the type of fig- ure, which can be used to augment interactions with a large corpus of scholarly literature.
he VizioMetrix platform processes a corpus of docu- ments, classifies the figures, organizes the results into a cloud- hosted databases, and drives three distinct applications to support bibliometric analysis and information retrieval. The first application supports information retrieval tasks by al- lowing rapid browsing of classified figures. The second ap- plication supports longitudinal analysis of visual patterns in the literature and facilitates data mining of these figures. The third application supports crowdsourced tagging of fig- ures to improve classification, augment search, and facilitate new kinds of analyses. Our initial corpus is the entirety of PubMed Central (PMC), and will be released to the public alongside this paper; we welcome other researchers to make use of these resources.",

    title: "Dynamic Visualization of Citation Networks Showing the Influence of Scholarly Fields Over Time (2016)",
    abstract: "Citation graphs between scholarly papers can be used to learn about the structure and development of scholarship. We present a generalizable approach to visualizing scholarly influence over time, using a dynamic node-link diagram representing the citation patterns between groups of papers. We combine this approach with hierarchical clustering techniques that exploit the network structure to partition the graph into clusters representing fields and subfields. We use these methods to explore the influence that fields have had on other fields over time.",

    title: "Static Ranking of Scholarly Papers using Article-Level Eigenfactor (ALEF) (2016)",
    abstract: "Microsoft Research hosted the 2016 WSDM Cup Challenge based on the Microsoft Academic Graph. The goal was to provide static rankings for the articles that make up the graph, with the rankings to be evaluated against those of human judges. While the Microsoft Academic Graph provided metadata about many aspects of each scholarly document, we focused more narrowly on citation data and used this contest as an opportunity to test the Article Level Eigenfactor (ALEF), a novel citation-based ranking algorithm, and evaluate its performance against competing algorithms that drew upon multiple facets of the data from a large, real world dataset (122M papers and 757M citations). Our final submission to this contest was scored at 0.676, earning second place.",

    title: "Scalable Flow-Based Community Detection for Large-Scale Network Analysis (2013)",
    abstract: "Community-detection is a powerful approach to uncover important structures in large networks. Since networks often describe flow of some entity, flow-based community-detection methods are particularly interesting. One such algorithm is called Infomap, which optimizes the objective function known as the map equation. While Infomap is known to be an effective algorithm, its serial implementation cannot take advantage of multicore processing in modern computers. In this paper, we propose a novel parallel generalization of Infomap called RelaxMap. This algorithm relaxes concurrency assumptions to avoid lock overhead, achieving 70% parallel efficiency in shared-memory multicore experiments while exhibiting similar convergence properties and finding similar community structures as the serial algorithm. We evaluate our approach on a variety of real graph datasets as well as synthetic graphs produced by a popular graph generator used for benchmarking community detection algorithms. We describe the algorithm, the experiments, and some emerging research directions in high-performance community detection on massive graphs.",

    abstract: "Designing software for exploring hierarchical data sets is challenging because users can easily become lost in large hierarchies. We present a novel interface, the hoptree, to assist users with navigating large hierarchies. The hoptree preserves navigational history and context and allows one-click naviga- tion to recently-visited locations. We describe the design of hoptrees and an im- plementation that we created for a tree exploration application. We discuss the potential for hoptrees to be used in a wide variety of hierarchy navigation sce- narios. Through a controlled experiment, we compared the effectiveness of hop- trees to a breadcrumb navigation interface. Study participants overwhelmingly preferred the hoptree, with improved time-on-task with no difference in error rates.",

    title: "Comparing the dynamics of stomatal networks to the problem-solving dynamics of cellular computers (2011)",
    abstract: "Is the adaptive response to environmental stimuli of a biological system lacking a central nervous system a result of a formal computation? If so, these biological systems must conform to a different set of computational rules than those associated with central processing. To explore this idea, we examined the dynamics of stomatal patchiness in leaves. Stomatau2014tiny pores on the surface of a leafu2014are biological processing units that a plant uses to solve an optimization problemu2014maximize CO2 assimilation and minimize H2O loss. Under some conditions, groups of stomata coordinate in both space and time producing motile patches that can be visualized with chlorophyll fluorescence. These patches suggest that stomata are nonautonomous and that they form a network presumably engaged in the optimization task. In this study, we show that stomatal dynamics are statistically and qualitatively comparable to the emergent, collective, problem-solving dynamics of cellular computing systems.",

    title: "Can Ignorance Promote Democracy? (2011)",
    abstract: "Ideas are like fire, observed Thomas Jefferson in 1813u2014information can be passed on without relinquishing it (1). Indeed, the ease and benefit of sharing information select for individuals to aggregate into groups, driving the buildup of complexity in the biological world (2, 3). Once the members of some collectiveu2014whether cells of a fruit fly or citizens of a democratic societyu2014have accumulated information, they must integrate that information and make decisions based upon it. When these members share a common interest, as do the stomata on the surface of a plant leaf (4), integrating distributed information may be a computational challenge. But when individuals do not have entirely coincident interests, strategic problems arise. Members of animal herds, for example, face a tension between aggregating information for the benefit of the herd as a whole, and avoiding manipulation by self-interested individuals in the herd. Which collective decision procedures are robust to manipulation by selfish players (5)? On page 1578 of this issue, Couzin et al. (6) show how the presence of uninformed agents can promote democratic outcomes in collective decision problems.",

    abstract: "As we pointed out in our original article (West,Bergstrom, & Bergstrom, in press), currency denominations generate a spurious correlation in the Big Mac data. The high correlation between wage rates and Big Mac prices denominated in local currency might lead a careless reader to believe that in all countries it takes a laborer about the same amount of time to earn a Big Mac. By rescaling currencies in a few of the countries, Prathap (in press) shows that this is not the case. Of course. Any competent statistician would do something like this. For example, when The Economist publishes their Big Mac index, they convert all prices into US dollars at prevailing currency exchange rates. That was the point of our analogyu2014to pick a case where the source of spurious correlation was so obvious that anyone could recognize the problem.",

This meritocratic approach to bibliometrics is very similar to the philosophy behind Googleu2019s PageRank algorithm, which is at u201cthe heart of [its] softwareu201d. Receiving a hyperlink from a highly reputable website means more than a hyperlink from a neighborhood blog. Both Google and Eigenfactor utilize the wealth of information inherent in the structure of their respective networks. For Google, that information can be found in the topology of the web, and for Eigenfactor, the information can be found in the citation structure of the scholarly literature. The success of Google's search engine illustrates the power of this approach to ranking. Part of the success behind PageRank can actually be traced back to prior work in the field of bibliometrics. With the advent of scholarly measures like Eigenfactor, this relationship has come full circle.",

    title: "Eigenfactor: ranking and mapping scientific knowledge (2010)",
    abstract: "Each year, tens of thousands of scholarly journals publish hundreds of thousands of scholarly papers, collectively containing tens of millions of citations. As De Solla Price recognized in 1965, these citations form a vast network linking up the collective research output of the scholarly community. These well-defined and well-preserved networks are model systems well suited for studying communication networks and the flow of information on these networks. In this dissertation, I explain how I used citation networks to develop an algorithm that I call 'Eigenfactor.' The goal of Eigenfactor is to mine the wealth of information contained within the full structure of the scholarly web, in order to identify the important nodes in these networks. This is dif-ferent from the conventional approach to scholarly evaluation. Metrics like impact factor ignore the network when ranking scholarly journals and only count incoming links. Eigenfactor not only counts citations but takes into account the source of those citations. By considering the whole network, I claim that Eigenfactor is a more information rich statistic. Librarians, publishers, editors and scholars around the world are now using Eigenfactor alongside impact factor to evaluate their journal collections. This dissertation consists of a collection of papers that provide an overview of Eigenfactor - what it is, what it measures and how it can be used to better evaluate and navigate the ever-expanding scholarly literature.",

    abstract: "This research studies the spatial and temporal dynamics of stomatal patchiness in order to investigate the possibility that plants solve their problem of adjusting stomatal aperture in order to maximize CO2 uptake while minimizing H2O loss through an emergent, distributed computation. An extensive study is done on qualitative and quantitative characteristics of stomatal patchiness, and improved imaging techniques are developed to more fully capture the dynamics. In doing so, soliton-like structures were discovered. Sequences of chlorophyll fluorescence images of Xanthium strumarium leaves were then compared to image sequences of cellular computer simulations that solve problems via emergent, distributed computation. Statistical analyses revealed that the spatial and temporal correlations of the patchy dynamics for the two types of images were indistinguishable.",
